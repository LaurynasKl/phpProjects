Getting Started
Here are a few steps to help you get started with the Task Tracker CLI project:

Set Up Your Development Environment
Choose a programming language you are comfortable with (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.).
Ensure you have a code editor or IDE installed (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm).
Project Initialization
Create a new project directory for your Task Tracker CLI.
Initialize a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your project.
Implementing Features
Start by creating a basic CLI structure to handle user inputs.
Implement each feature one by one, ensuring to test thoroughly before moving to the next e.g. implement adding task functionality first, listing next, then updating, marking as in progress, etc.
Testing and Debugging
Test each feature individually to ensure they work as expected. Look at the JSON file to verify that the tasks are being stored correctly.
Debug any issues that arise during development.
Finalizing the Project
Ensure all features are implemented and tested.
Clean up your code and add comments where necessary.
Write a good readme file on how to use your Task Tracker CLI.
